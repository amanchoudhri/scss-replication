# scss-replication

Replication experiment and robustness analysis of a 2021 randomized controlled trial studying the Safe Communities Safe Schools (SCSS) educational intervention.
This is my final project for Don Green's POLS GU4724 class on Randomized Experimentation at Columbia. 

Analysis is in [this notebook](replicate.Rmd) with a knitted PDF [here](replicate.pdf). The final report is available at [doc/report.pdf](doc/report.pdf).
