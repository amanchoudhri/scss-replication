## File Descriptions

- `DS0001`: School-level attendance rates at baseline (year 0) and in year 1. Also
  includes school-level covariates (attendance by year, free/reduced price lunch
  eligibility composition, teacher/student ratios, etc)
- `DS0002`: School-level attendance rates at baseline (year 0) and in year 2.
- `DS0003`: School-level truancy rates at baseline (year 0) and in year 1.
- `DS0004`: School-level truancy rates at baseline (year 0) and in year 2.
- `DS0002`: School-level attendance rates at baseline (year 0) and in year 2.
- `DS0005`: School-level year-1 suspension outcomes (in-school, out-of-school,
  and total suspension percentages).
- `DS0006`: School-level year-2 suspension outcomes.
- `DS0007`: Student-level academic outcome measuresâ€”achievement scores on
  standardized exams from grades 6 through 8. The researchers partnered with the
  Colorado Department of Education to obtain this individual-level information,
  even from schools who became non-responsive during the project period.
  This dataframe represents measurements taken in 2017 or 2018; it was sent in Jan 2019.
- `DS0008`: Again, student-level academic outcome measures. This dataframe is
  measurements taken in 2018 or 2019; it was sent in Jan 2020.
- `DS0009`: Student school climate surveys. All sites had baseline surveys
  administered in the year before the program began. Note: only students with
  signed parental consent forms were eligible to take the survey. It seems like
  this was a major issue: "For the student survey, the biggest challenge that
  arose was in collecting the active consent forms from parents."
  
- `DS0010`: Staff school climate surveys. Potentially minor participation issues.
  Response rates in the 70s usually.

- `DS0011`: Mid-implementation surveys from schools, questions about program assessment,
  implementation challenges encountered, comfort with running the program, etc.
  
  Minor response issues in year 3 with the G3 schools. G1 schools had a >100%
  response rate ( 82 responses received, 79 expected), G2 had 85.% (220/258),
  and G3 had 70% response (45/64). Response also dropped off from year-to-year
  within eeach cohort of schools.

- `DS0012`: Implementation rating sheets from SCSS team members,
  describing each school's implementation of the program. In year 1 they rated
  whether the school "convened and maintained healthy teams" and whether the
  school adhered to evidence-based practices (collecting school climate data and
  using it to guide violence prevention programming); in year 2, they additionally
  rated the general implementation of the evidence-based program.
